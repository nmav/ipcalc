.SH NAME
ipcalc \- perform simple operations on IP addresses and networks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ipcalc
[\fIOPTION\fR]... <\fBIP address\fR>[\fI/prefix\fR] [\fInetmask\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBipcalc\fR provides a simple way to calculate IP information for a host
or network. Depending on the options specified, it may be used to provide
IP network information in human readable format, in a format suitable for
parsing in scripts, generate random private addresses, resolve an IP address,
or check the validity of an address.

By default or when the \fB\-\-info\fR or \fB\-\-all\-info\fR parameters
are specified the information provided is human readable. Otherwise,
when specific options are given (e.g., \fB\-\-prefix\fR) the output is
in the VAR=VALUE format.

The various options specify what information \fBipcalc\fR should display
on standard out. Multiple options may be specified.  An IP address to
operate on must always be specified, and several operations also require
a netmask or a CIDR prefix as well.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
Validate the IP address under the specified family. 

.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-info\fR 
Display generic information on the provided network in human readable format (default).

.TP
\fB\-\-all\-info\fR 
Display verbose information on the provided network and addresses in human
readable format. That includes GeoIP information.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-random-private\fR
Generate a random private address using the supplied prefix or mask. By default
it displays output in human readable format, but may be combined with 
other options (e.g., \fB\-\-network\fR) to display specific information in
VAR=VALUE format.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-hostname\fR
Display the hostname for the given IP address.
The variable exposed is HOSTNAME.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-lookup-host\fR
Display the IP address for the given hostname.
The variable exposed is ADDRESS.

.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-ipv4\fR
Explicitly specify the IPv4 address family.

.TP
\fB\-6\fR, \fB\-\-ipv6\fR
Explicitly specify the IPv6 address family.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-broadcast\fR
Display the broadcast address for the given IP address and netmask.
The variable exposed is BROADCAST (if available).

.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-geoinfo\fR
Display geographic information for the given IP address. This option
requires libGeoIP to be available. The variables exposed are
COUNTRYCODE, COUNTRY, CITY and COORDINATES (when available).

.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-netmask\fR
Calculate the netmask for the given IP address. If no mask or prefix
is provided, in IPv6 a 128-bit mask is assumed, while in IPv4 it assumes
that the IP address is in a complete class A, B, or C network. Note, 
however, that many networks no longer use the default netmasks in IPv4.
The variable exposed is NETMASK.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-prefix\fR
Show the prefix for the given mask/IP address.
The variable exposed is PREFIX.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-network\fR 
Display the network address for the given IP address and netmask.
The variable exposed is NETWORK.

.TP
\fB\   \fR \fB\-\-minaddr\fR 
Display the minimum host address in the provided network.
The variable exposed is MINADDR.

.TP
\fB\   \fR \fB\-\-maxaddr\fR 
Display the maximum host address in the provided network.
The variable exposed is MAXADDR.

.TP
\fB\   \fR \fB\-\-addresses\fR 
Display the number of host addresses in the provided network.
The variable exposed is ADDRESSES.

.TP
\fB\   \fR \fB\-\-addrspace\fR 
Display address space allocation information for the provided network.
The variable exposed is ADDRSPACE.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR 
Don't ever display error messages.
